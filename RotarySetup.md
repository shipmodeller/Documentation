Some general notes on using a rotary attachment:

If the object slips on the rollers of a roller type attachment, wrap the rollers with some sort of non-slip material or even rubber bands.
You can also try placing some weights inside the object such as ball bearings or other small round objects, this will help press the object against the rollers.
Remember to uncheck the use rotary attachment check box once you are finished so that you do not mess up your next regular project.
